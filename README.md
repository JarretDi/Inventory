# TTRPG Character/Inventory management system

## What is this application?
This application will provide an organized way to add, view and filter characters, items, etc. for games like D&D and Pathfinder, which are traditionally done pen and paper, but lately things like laptops and tablets are used to more effectively keep track of information within the game. Ideally, this is meant to be used by players who have a difficult time keeping track of what exactly is in their inventory, but also provides an easy way for organized players to save some time as well. I found that through playing various games, the main way to keep track of these things is through noting them down manually in a text editor, which often requires those small notes to be referenced in the rulebook *every single* time for *each item* a player wants to use. This project is an attempt to remedy this by sorting items by categories (i.e. consumable, weapon, armour) so that the information represented by each item is both easy to find and easy to access.
